# Refusing GenAI in Writing Studies: A Quickstart Guide - Premise Summary

1. Writing studies teacher-scholars understand the relationship between language, power, and persuasion.

This premise focuses on the language used to describe GenAI and its uses, how none of those descriptors are fully accurate, and due to those descriptors we risk either underestimating or overestimating GenAI and its capabilities. Language is also used to get more people to use GenAI by using terms that make GenAI seem “inherently good.”

2. Writing studies teacher-scholars understand the broad purposes and uses of writing in the world.

Unlike people, GenAI is incapable of writing with the purposes of building connections, self-expression, and deep thinking or inquiry. This means that GenAI may produce good writing but it will never be innovative or be able to replace what actual writing instruction can create.

3. Writing studies as a discipline stands against linguistic homogenization, which is accelerated and advanced by GenAI.

GenAI has been known to erase dialects and language variation, and has claimed certain dialects as “non-standard” and unfit for academic papers.

4. Writing studies as a discipline rejects punitive approaches to plagiarism and plagiarism surveillance.

Being so focused on plagiarism in works has resulted in false positives that negatively impact students and has made it harder to build learning environments built upon trust and openness.

5. Writing studies scholarship has demonstrated that technologies, including GenAI, are never ideologically neutral.

GenAI is trained on all manner of texts, all of which are biased in some way.

6. Writing studies as a discipline has taken up histories of digital writing technologies that provide important context for understanding our current GenAI moment.

Due to how previous writing technologies have been received it is unlikely that GenAI as it is will be what is widely used around the world in the future.

7. Writing teachers are well-poised to understand the range of labor issues that come with GenAI adoption.

GenAI have exacerbated things revolving precarious labor issues with it inclusion in writing programs

8. Writing teachers must be critical of the rhetorical and economic contexts surrounding GenAI, including the various ways that GenAI is promoted and marketed.

Those who promote GenAI are those who stand to either gain or lose the most when it comes to whether GenAI is adopted or not.

9. Writing studies must consider the environmental impacts of GenAI as well as other digital technologies that rely on massive datasets such as Zoom and Facebook.

It takes a lot of clean water and energy to keep GenAI tools running which negatively impacts the environment.

10. Refusal can be a principled and pragmatic response to the incursion of GenAI technologies in college writing courses.

Due to the previous principles it can be rational to also the refusal of using GenAI in college writing courses.

Due to this being the first knowledge base assignment since starting this new unit there aren't any other posts that discuss this sort of conent yet. There are some, however, that use the same sort of formating in that they are summarizing or putting different parts of the readings in their own words.
