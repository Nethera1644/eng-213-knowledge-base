## _The Remix_
 ***Remix is how we as humans live and everyone within our society engages in this act of creativity.‚Äù***  (Devoss & Ridolfo 2).
 
 Remixing is a large part of digital culture by taking old videos, images, texts, etc and reworking them into something else. The remix can also be remixed, thus also being apart of a digital landscape within the remix culture. As of today, Remixing has gained a massive online community
 
 ## _Concepts to Understand to Understand the Remix better_

**Digital Literacy and Digital Rhetoric**

-- In a video called "Digital Literacies Interview: Dr. Douglas Eyman" on Youtube, Dr. Douglas Eyman gives a definiton for digital literacies and digital rhetoric.

-- "... I tend to think of literacies as skills and abilities and practices and knowledge thereof that allow for communicating digitally... digital rhetoric is how you use them [digital literacies] is how you use them effectively toward a particular moment of persuasion to inform, to persuade, to entertain, whatever your end goal is" (Eyman, 4:16).

-- *Remixing is a type of digital literacy. People communicate digitally by using the practice of the remix. People partake in digital rhetoric when making remixes because they effectively use their skills to entertain (though in some instances they use it for other purposes).*

**Cyberculture**

 -- A type of communication and various social aspects found online. 

-- "Examples of what falls under cyberculture studies are online communities,
online multi-player gaming, the issue of online identity, the sociology and the ethnography of email usage, cell phone usage in various communities" (Manovich 8).

-- *When considering this definition, we can see that the remix falls under a cyberculture as it is an online community who partakes in making these remixes (The Remix Community).*

## _How can this be used?: Rhetorical Velocity._
- On page two of "COMPOSING FOR RECOMPOSITION:
RHETORICAL VELOCITY AND DELIVERY", a question about remixing is asked: "Likely, however, Tay Zonday did not write and produce his original piece with remix in mind. So what does it mean to take future composing and re-composition into strategic consideration while composing? That is, what does it mean to compose with re-composition in mind" (Devoss & Ridolfo 2). 
- This can be answered by a concept called ***Rhetorical Velocity***.

**Rhetorical Velocity**

-- Rhetorical Velocity is a stragetic understanding of how texts work and how the text might be recomposed in a way that benefits the rhetorician. 

-- Also refers in which digital literacies and information go across the digital and physical space.
 
## _Affordances of these concepts._
**Remixing**

- Used more for entertainment purposes online, but can afford the user benefits like being able to join and connect with people in online communities, spreading messages in a form of content that is fun and easy to digest by using digital literacy skills, and being able to learn new ways to spread content in the digital world.

**Rhetorical Velocity**

- Affords the user in multiple ways. Being able to have a stragetic understanding of how texts might be recomposed to benefit you might change the way you think about the text, format the text, or where you post the text to get more positive benefits, thus gaining more from the text.
- Being able to understand how quickly it will spread across the digital/physical space makes the user consider what types of digital literacy and rhetoric to use to make your texts reach their target audience more and time it to produce more benefits from said audience.

- Overall, makes the user think more critically and deeply in the digital landscape.
